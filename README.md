# EDA-hotel-booking- Python Capstone project
my ist project ..Hotel booking analysis
# Problem Statement
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!
## Project Description
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.
## Conclusion


Moslty bookings are done by couples(although we are not sure that they are couple as data doesn't tell about that)

It is clear from graph that their is a sudden surge in arrival num of couples and family in months of July and August. So better plans can be planned accordingly at that time for these type of customers.
